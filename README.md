# CutFEM for transformation fronts in multi-physics continuum

_Modelling of propagation of phase boundaries in arbitrary multi-physics continuum in 2D._

## Summary

The code represents the evolution of the previous CutFEM implementation[^1]. Therefore, the user is referred to the README file of the previous implementation for the summary and details. In this version, the non-linear mechanics has been changed to arbitrary multi-physics problem. At the moment, three constitutive laws are included: magneto-mechanics, non-linear mechanics, ferromagnetism.

The code supplements the upcoming publication on transformation fronts in deformable ferromagnets, where the details will be provided.

## Getting started

The same instructions as for the previous implementation for running the code are applicable.

## Developer and acknowledgements

The code's developer is Dr. M. Poluektov.
